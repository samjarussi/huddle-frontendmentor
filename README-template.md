## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

It was my first time building a website from scratch without guidance; this was the most significant learning.
It was a wake-up call and an opportunity to review my recent lessons and put them together.

I've learned how to play with divs, a little bit more about hover effects, and some other elements, such as display, position, float, margin, padding and border-radius.

The main challenges were creating the nav bar, using float, and aligning inline-block elements.

Once I had almost finished the website, I had to learn from scratch Responsive Design.

Some code snippets below:

```css
.button {
    background-color: white;
    border: none;
    color: #808D99;
    padding: 15px 32px;
    margin-top: 0;
    margin-right: 5%;
    text-align: center;
    text-decoration: none;
    display: inline-block;
    font-size: 16px;
    border-radius: 30px;
    font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
    position: relative;
    float: right;
}
```

```css
.button-pink:hover {
    background: white;
    color: #FF1493;
    text-decoration: none;
}
```

### Continued development

It is still not automatic to build a website from scratch to me. I will build a second one right after this to keep learning it and ensure that some things will become intuitive and natural.

The next step will be to learn Bootstrap.
